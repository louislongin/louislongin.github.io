<!-- Learning analytics frameworks are equivocal that learners should be active in deciding what to do with their data in educational technologies. However, learners do not engage meaningfully with data sharing decisions that are at the core of informed consent. Recent research shows that discussions with others boost learner engagement with data sharing decisions. According to emerging research, discussions where individuals exchange opinions about data sharing resulted in more cautious decision choices afterwards. It remains unclear whether the quality of these discussions contributed to this effect. To further understand the effect of the discussion quality, we analysed how students made arguments about data-sharing, using 96 short discussions from 12 groups. By combining content analysis, clustering, and linear mixed-effects modelling, we examined if a particular way of argumentation in a group affected subsequent individual data-sharing decisions. We found that data-sharing discussions were characterised by assertions and supportive statements, but that overall evidence-based reasoning was limited. Three argumentation patterns were observed: critical argumentation, high engagement argumentation, and low engagement argumentation. Discussions where learners critically argued their data sharing positions showed a negative effect on their data sharing decisions after the discussion. These findings suggest that participatory practices for data sharing such as interactive consent require scaffolds to support argumentation quality and improve decision-making. -->
