Digital technologies have fundamentally transformed how we share personal data, challenging long-standing privacy norms and raising urgent questions about data protection in the modern age. While sharing personal data has become increasingly normalized, from social media interactions to workplace surveillance, we lack a clear understanding of how privacy norms should evolve to address these changes. This project investigates the social norms governing data sharing through the lens of contextual integrity, combining philosophical analysis with empirical research.

The research explores two critical dimensions of modern privacy norms. First, it examines how individuals navigate data-sharing decisions across different contexts, from health data to location tracking, revealing that people become more selective and thoughtful about sharing data after group deliberation. Through experimental studies using interactive games and vignette methodologies, the work demonstrates that social deliberation can help restore sensitivity to privacy considerations that may be eroded through constant data-sharing demands.

Second, the project challenges traditional forms of informed consent. Rather than requiring individuals to make isolated decisions about data sharing based on lengthy, standardized consent forms, this research demonstrates the value of interactive, socially-grounded consent processes. The findings suggest that meaningful consent emerges through collective deliberation where individuals can discuss contextual factors, share perspectives, and calibrate their judgments against social norms. This participatory approach recognizes that privacy decisions are inherently social and contextual, requiring more nuanced engagement than the current top-down frameworks allow.

This work addresses a critical gap in privacy research by moving beyond individual privacy preferences to examine how social norms and collective deliberation shape data-sharing practices. The findings suggest that participatory approaches, where people discuss and negotiate privacy boundaries together, may be key to developing more nuanced and effective privacy protections for the digital age.
