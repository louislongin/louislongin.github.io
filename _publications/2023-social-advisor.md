<!-- Artificial Intelligence (AI) profoundly affects how people communicate, work, and perceive the world. While autonomous AI systems are the focal point in societal and academic discussions, advisory AI systems, which influence human decisions but don't undertake independent actions, often remain unexplored. Examples range from automated purchase recommendations to medical diagnoses. This dissertation seeks to understand what advisory AI systems truly are. Are they capable of autonomous, human-like action? Or can they be reduced to inert tools? And what happens when advisory AI systems are closely linked with human perception, especially through Augmented Reality and sensory augmentation? Does their ontological status change? This dissertation concludes that, regardless of their implementation, advisory AI systems occupy an ontological status between tools and humans. They are more than just tools but less than humans. -->
