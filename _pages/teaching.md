## Teaching Philosophy

My passion for teaching philosophy extends beyond the classroom, focusing on nurturing both academic excellence and personal growth in my students. Through carefully designed coursework, students engage with fundamental theories, cutting-edge concepts, and contemporary debates while developing practical research skills that serve them throughout their academic journey.

## Guiding Principles

**Transparency**
I believe in clear communication of course objectives, expectations, and evaluation criteria. Students receive detailed syllabi, rubrics, and regular feedback to understand their learning trajectory and areas for growth. This approach ensures that learning outcomes are clearly defined and achievable, allowing students to take ownership of their educational journey.

**Relevance**
Course content is carefully curated to bridge theoretical foundations with real-world applications. Students explore how philosophical concepts inform current societal issues, scientific developments, and ethical debates. This connection between theory and practice helps students understand the immediate relevance of philosophical thinking to contemporary challenges.

**Activation**
Learning is an active process where students engage critically with course material through structured discussions, independent research, and collaborative projects. This approach develops both analytical and practical skills, preparing students for academic and professional success.

## Teaching Methology

**Interactive Learning**
The classroom serves as a dynamic space where knowledge is co-created through meaningful dialogue and engagement. Students participate in small group discussions and debates that challenge their assumptions and develop critical thinking skills. Socratic dialogues form the foundation of our classroom interactions, while problem-based learning scenarios encourage practical application of theoretical concepts.

**Diverse Teaching Methods**
My teaching incorporates multimedia presentations that bring complex ideas to life through visual and audio elements. Digital learning platforms extend our discussions beyond the classroom, while case study analyses ground philosophical concepts in real-world contexts. Simulation exercises allow students to experience philosophical dilemmas firsthand, and reflective writing assignments deepen their understanding through personal engagement with the material.

## Student Supervision

**Research Development**
As a dedicated mentor, I provide comprehensive guidance through regular consultation sessions and structured milestone planning. Students receive support in developing robust research methodologies and refining their academic writing. Through writing workshops and peer review sessions, students learn to articulate their ideas with clarity and precision.

**Professional Growth**
My supervision extends beyond academic guidance to include professional development. Students receive training in research presentation techniques and guidance on academic publishing. I encourage and support conference participation, helping students build their professional networks and academic profiles. Career development advice is tailored to each studentâ€™s aspirations and goals.

## Current Courses

At the undergraduate level, I teach foundational courses like a German introduction into philosophy of mind, covering traditional and current approaches to the mind-body problem, the nature of perception, consciousness, and personal identity.
My graduate courses focus on advanced research methods and contemporary philosophical debates like mental representations, the social influence on perception, and the philosophy of data privacy.
