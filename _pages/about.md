I am an assistant professor in philosophy working on data and mental privacy at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) in Munich, Germany. My current research focuses on a) uncovering the social norms behind data-sharing decisions, b) mental privacy around neurotechnologies, and c) empowering individuals through social deliberation and informed consent when sharing data. This includes theoretical as well as empirical work on data privacy, social decision-making, and mental integrity, utilising a combination of philosophical and psychological methods. 

Previous work has focused on human-AI responsibility sharing, the social influence on perception, and intelligent sensory augmentation. My PhD analysed the social role of AI advisors. I asked whether advisory artificial intelligence (AI) systems are classified as mere tools or human-like agents, and provided conceptual and empirical reasons that they are something in between. Throughout my PhD, I was a fully funded Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt) fellow.

Besides philosophy, I am the co-founder of a public-facing 'AI-workshop' series that brings technical, ethical, and practical knowledge around AI systems to the general public. Before, I was the Academic Director of [ThinkTech](https://www.thinktech.ngo/), a non-profit organization discussing the societal impact of technology. 

I am part of the Cognition, Values and Behaviour group ([CVBE](https://www.cvbe.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/index.html)) lab and the Munich Intelligence Initiative ([Mi3](https://mi3.info/)).
